# MMDA-Timeline-Tools

TODO:
Scripts for increasing NUKnightLab TimelineJS3 Functionality for MMDA Project

Changes for test_timeline.py:

output 4 files: allEvents.json, publicationEvents.json, historyEvents.json, lifeEvents.json

Each of these should put all events into "events" and include a single "title" object


Create a multiple timeline view test html page from the "timeline" folder example on Box.com.
Make a page that allows you to see all the different timelines loaded.

Newsletters clean up for a break or if you get stuck on timeline.

For follow up later in break or January ... get the development version running and get Ed to set it up on the moorearchive server.

Prepare for Demo! 


A/N: change to add to events dictionary, add id, look into adding string tags (ask about styling, layout)
-show for demo easiness of data entry, adding info/updating (google forms -> google csv)
